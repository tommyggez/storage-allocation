# How should you allocate limited space in a warehouse?

If we have limited space in a warehouse which is stocked periodically, how do we decide how to allocate the space for different products in order to maximise expected profit?
We need to value both the profitability of the product, and the distribution of demand for the product.
We need to balance the losses incurred by the possibility of running out of any product.

Here we use some basic assumptions to optimise allocations given basic information about products.
